# Nachos
The SDU OS project based on Nachos
## Lab 1 Buid Nachos
## Lab 3 Using semaphores to achieve thread synchronization
The codes in ring.h,ring.cc and prodcons++.cc are completed to solve the producer/consumer problem.  
## Lab 4 Nachos file system
The purpose of this lab is to help understand Nachos file sytem better.  
## Lab 5 extended Nachos file system
I tried to extend Nachos's file system so that files' size is changable(code/lab5),and Some work was done to files' MAX size.(code/lab5.1)  
## Lab 6 User program and system call
The purpose of the experiment is to help us understand the format of Nachos executable files and pave the way for lab7 and lab8.  
## Lab 7 Address space expansion
The AddrSpace class is extended to implement multi-threading.   
All the changes are in code/lab7-8.  
## Lab 8 The implementation of some system calls
the codes are in code/lab7-8.The implementation of Exit(),Exec(),Join(),Read(),Write() is included.And there are some changes in the thread.h(.cc) and system.h(.cc) to implement all the system calls above.
