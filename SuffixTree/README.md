# SuffixTree

The Ukkonen algorithm is implemented in this project to create suffix tree  
The code of Ukkonen algorithm takes https://github.com/QCompson/suffixtree-ukkonen-algorithm as inference  
  
    
This project also includes some application of suffix tree :
1.To make sure a string A is a substring of string B or not  
2.Count the occurrences of string A in string B  
3.Find the substring while has the maximum number of repetitions  
4.Find the longest common substring of string A and String B
