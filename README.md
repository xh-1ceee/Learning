# Learning
This repository contains some of my course designs and experiment codes.  
## Computer Graphics
The fileholder includes the C++ implementation of some cg algorithms.(course experiment codes)  
Bezier,Bresenham,scanlinefill,Sutherland-Hogman and Cohen-Sutherland are included.  
## Nachos
This fileholder contains a course design based on Nachos.  
Some details are described in the README.md of this holder.  
## Suffix tree
The C++ implementation of suffix tree.Some details are in the README.md.  
## BM25 
The program is used for measuring the relavance between a given query and all documents stored in json format.The code is mainly based on BM25 algorithm,and some tricks include stop words and lemmatization are applied.Training set,validation set and test set are contained in the folder.  
## PL0 Compiler
This is a course design project for compiler principles————a compiler for PL0 programming language written in C++.  
The complier only gives the intermediate codes due to course time constraint.And there are still some problems remain.

Maybe someday I will review these codes :D
